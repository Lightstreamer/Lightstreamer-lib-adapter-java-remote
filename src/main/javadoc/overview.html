<p>This package includes the resources needed to develop Remote Data Adapters and Remote Metadata Adapters for Lightstreamer Server with Java.<br>

Each Lightstreamer session requires the presence of an Adapter Set, which is made up of one Metadata Adapter and one or multiple Data Adapters. Multiple Adapter Sets can be plugged onto Lightstreamer Server. The adapters will run in a separate process, communicating with the Server through corresponding Proxy Adapters embedded in the Lightstreamer server.</p>
